Bugs
----

* When executing the "clear" shell command, the new screen has a newline at the
  top


Small Tasks
-----------

* Make all the shell commands callable just by typing them (without having to
  add the parens)
  * can't just make them properties, 'cause they'll get called when the
    namespace is created
* Add support for dynamic prompts
    * Display time, day/night/sun location, weather, month, season, year, etc.
      at each prompt
    * Allow for time multipliers


Bigger Items
------------

* Split out SSH Server code into a separate project?
  * makebe call it DreamShell?
  * make prakaha-bot use it
  * make inversum use it
* Split out game and game engine?
  * update myriad-worlds to use DreamSSH?
  * myriad-worlds is very large in scope, though... designed for full-on RPG
    games
  * perhaps a DreamMUD?
* Update SSH server to accept keys from non-~/.ssh dirs
  * store keys in configured dir
  * maaybe subdirs, divided by user?
* Add a custom shell, not a python prompt
  * Integrate code from OpenPIX (commands, autocompletion)
  * Copy OpenPIX shell code into inversum.shell.gameshell
* Integrate code from Myriad Worlds (moving from room to room)
* Support live-updating the game
  * edit the maps in-game
  * update room descriptions in-game
* Add support for roles
  * limit contents of namespace based on role
  * Wizard, Player, others?
* Added support for full command list:
